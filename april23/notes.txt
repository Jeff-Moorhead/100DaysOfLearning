snap -> includes all requirements including dependencies and runs packages in sandbox environments
    - Allows you to install multiple versions of the same package
    Commands
        $ snap install
        $ snap list
        $ snap refresh  # updates snaps
        $ snap refresh --hold spotify  # stop automatic updates of spotify snap
    
    - By default, snapd looks for updates four times a day

apt -> installs dependencies as separate .deb packages and runs directly on host system
     - may leave cruft on system after package deletion


User Management
===============

# This is to experiment with overthewire ideas
$ sudo apt adduser

tee allows you to pipe output into other users files as root (normal redirecting is not done as root so using sudo doesn't work)

The last entry for the user in /etc/passwd is the default shell used for this user

Solution to 25->26
------------------

Scale down your terminal window until `more` enters command mode (i.e. it can't fit the entire file in the window).
Use the 'v' command in `more` to open the file in vim
Use :e /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26 to open the password file for bandit26
Set the shell FROM VIM using :set shell=/bin/bash
Finally, open a shell from vim with :shell

This was a hard one. This is what hacking is all about. Using the tools available to you in creative ways to exploit
vulnerabilities.

To see all users in the system (usernames only): `cut -d : -f 1 /etc/passwd`
