All passwords are available somehow in /etc/bandit_pass! Remember that!

timeout is a command-line utility that runs a specified command and terminates it if it is still running after a given period of time. In other words, timeout allows you to run a command with a time limit. The timeout command is a part of the GNU core utilities package, which is installed on almost any Linux distribution.

# My solution:
--------------
#!/usr/bin/bash

echo Hi, I am running! > verify # this is to debug some permissions issues I was having
output=/tmp/tmp.Stv8XYt71b/password
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > $output

Solution to Level 24 -> Level 25:

# From shell:
$ ./bandit25_pass.sh | nc localhost 30002


ssh
---

Every user has a default shell -> ssh uses the default shell

default shell is shown in /etc/passwd file


WHAT WE KNOW IN 25 -> 26
------------------------

bandit26 uses /usr/bin/showtext for it's login shell (as seen in /etc/passwd)
there is a file ~bandit26/text.txt that gets more'ed by this custom shell.
the shell is viewable and executable by all users, but there needs to be a ~/text.txt present in the user's home directory.
I can't touch new files into the home directory (permission denied), so I'm not sure how to run this shell
