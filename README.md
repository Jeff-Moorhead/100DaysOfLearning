A Look Into How I Spent 100 Days Learning
=========================================

Hi, if you're reading this, you're probably just as surprised as I am.
This repository is a time capsule. A brief telling of my study habits
over a 100 day period.

There may not seem to be a whole lot of order to the contents of this
repo. There isn't. That's the point. I approached this project as a
way to allow myself freedom. Does it ever seem like there's always
something else to learn? Another project to get to? And yet, most of
us feel guilt from not finishing projects we started. So I decided to
let the chaos _be_ the project. For 100 days, I will code, or do
some other technical thing, and store the contents of that process here.
There really aren't any other rules. If I decide to stick with a project
for more than a day, so be it. I'm just seeing where I end up.
